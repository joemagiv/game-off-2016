Muntz is a puzzle game inspired by the work of TV Pioneer Earl "Madman" Muntz:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madman_Muntz

Originally a used car salesman (his prices were so low he was a madman) he turned his interest to televisions. He would take contemporary sets and start removing components until they stopped working and then replacing the last piece. Through this process (later to be known as "Muntzing") he figured out TVs could be produced with many fewer components and released the first television sold in America for less than $100.

Muntz takes its namesake's lead and presents you with an overly complex circuit of components, you must figure out which pieces are unnecessary and simplify the circuit.Try things out, rip it apart, put it back together!


Go forth and *Muntz*!
